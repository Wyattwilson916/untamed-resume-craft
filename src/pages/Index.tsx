              Unity developer who fell into game development through a mission-driven project and stayed because of a deep love for coding gameplay and solving tough design problems. I solo-developed BeTuned from start to finish â€” designing every system, writing every script, and building a fully playable experience from the ground up. I thrive when I can take raw ideas and turn them into polished, responsive systems that just feel good to play.
