        I'm a Unity developer with a strong focus on gameplay programming, system design, and building clean, scalable architecture. I recently solo-developed BeTuned, a rhythm-based mobile game built entirely in Unity. I created every aspect of the project from the ground up â€” including core gameplay, UI/UX, analytics, and backend systems. I enjoy solving complex problems, writing maintainable code, and delivering polished experiences.
