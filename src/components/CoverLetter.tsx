        <p className="mb-4">Dear Mixpanel Support Team,</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          I'm excited to apply for the Support Engineer position at Mixpanel. With a background in software development and hands on experience supporting users, I'm drawn to the chance to work where customer service, technical problem solving, and product analytics meet. Mixpanel's mission to make data accessible without SQL fits my interest in tools that let people answer their own questions.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          At Fullstack Academy, I've worked with SQL, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, browser developer tools, Slack, and Thunder Client. That foundation in web tech and API interactions helps me troubleshoot from both the front end and back end. While working on BeTuned, a published mobile game, I got comfortable with mobile SDKs, used Google Analytics to track player behavior, and kept the team organized in Slack and Trello. I haven't used a formal ticketing platform like Zendesk, but I've fielded plenty of customer questions and know how to keep explanations clear and friendly.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          I'm eager to join a team that values technical depth and user focused support. I'd love to dive into Mixpanel, learn the platform inside and out, and help your customers get the answers they need fast. Thank you for considering my application. I'd welcome the chance to talk more about how I can help.
        </p>

          Sincerely,<br />
